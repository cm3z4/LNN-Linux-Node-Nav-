# Vicki

### Description

Vicki is a Node.js application built to easily navigate a Unix-like/Linux system with a command-line interface (CLI). This allows a complete beginner to use a terminal to read/write and remove files/directories without learning any basic shell commands. Navigating is as simple as pressing a number to change directories.

*My wife says I never do anything for her, so I named this program after her...*
