# Vicki

### Description

Vicki is a Node.js application built to easily navigate a Unix-like/Linux system with a command-line interface (CLI). This allows a complete beginner to use a terminal to read/write and remove files/directories without learning any basic shell commands. Changing directories is as simple as entering a number.

*My wife says I never do anything for her, so I named this program after her...*

### Features
- Set a custom home (starting) path.
- Directory indexing for easy navigation.
- Read UTF-8 files.
- Create text files.
- Delete files and directories.
- View images (png & jpg) in the terminal.
- Show hidden files.
- Show history.

### Developing Features
- Play audio/video files.
- Copy files/directories.
- Compress files/directories.
- Extract files/directories.
- History logging.

### Installing
- Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- Clone and extract this repository on your system.
- Open up the repository in a terminal and run "npm i".
- Enter your starting path in the config.js file and save.
- Finally, run "node vicki.js".

I created a bash/zsh alias to globally execute vicki.js from anywhere on my system. I will eventually write an installation script to expedite this process for all.
